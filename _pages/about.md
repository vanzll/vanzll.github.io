# üòä About me

Greetings! I am Zhenglin Wan, an undergraduate student at CUHK-Shenzhen, majoring in Data Science. You can find my most-updated CV at [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fYYlj0MhJGsPPDdWUMB9LHMTqUo3bL1s/view?usp=sharing).

During high school, I was fortunate to win the first prize in the Chinese High School Mathematics Olympics, during which I developed personalized paradigm of learning and the habit of independent study. This enables me to achieve nearly all A grades (4.0/4.0) in my major-related courses (statistics, mathematics, and computer science) in a self-directed way, which allowed me to save time and engage in challenging and interesting research projects. My primary research interests lie in: 1) **Decision-Making in Machine Learning**: How to embed the human's learning and decision-making patterns into machine's learning paradigm, such as Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Multi-agent systems? I am also interested in adopting statistics and optimization view to understand these problems.  2) **The application of decision-making support systems in urban context**: such as smart transportation systems, environment monitoring, etc.

I have been an intern researcher at [Centre for Frontier AI Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar), [(A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) at Singapore, under the supervision of [Dr. Xingrui Yu](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/yu-xingrui) and [Prof. Ivor Tsang](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang). During my undergraduate, I am lucky to work with [Dr. Jun Song](https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/persons/JUNSONG) and co-found one company, as technical collaborator, named "Metasequoia Intelligence" with him. We have published serveral invention patents and academic papers together. Prior to that, I was the key member of the research group of Prof. [Jianfeng Mao](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/268), playing a key role in a project regarding decision-making systems in transportation network.

- Imitation learning (IL) approaches succeed in fast adaptation for dozens of applications. However, traditional IL assumes the demonstrations comes from one specific expert policy, thus containing only one behavior pattern. This way may result in the lack of robustness of agent to deal with various and unpredicatable real-world situations.
- To address above issue, this work pioneers a new paradigm- learning from diverse behaviors. We proposed a novel quality-diversity imitation learning model to enable the agent to learn a broad set of skills from limited but diverse demonstrations. With multiple viable and high-performing skills equipped, the agent can robustly deal with unseen and stochastic environment.

# Personal Life and History
When I'm not immersed in research, I‚Äôm an avid **music enthusiast**. I‚Äôve been playing guitar for over a decade and began teaching myself the piano and electronic piano at the age of 15. Music has always been a significant part of my life. During my undergraduate years, I had the incredible opportunity to play in two bands: "Minor Blue" and "Major Pink." The experience of performing on and off campus, sharing the stage with talented musicians, and connecting with audiences through music was truly exhilarating. These moments of creative expression and collaboration remain some of my most cherished memories.

I was once a patient with moderate Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder **(OCD, Âº∫Ëø´Áóá in Chinese)**, a mental illness as painful as depression. My mind would get stuck on simple problems, both academic and personal, and I couldn‚Äôt control it. I self-rescued through reading mind-philosophy books and exploring Buddhist and Taoist philosophies. The most inspiring part of this journey was learning to practice mindfulness‚Äîobserving what was happening inside my mind and finding inner peace, allowing my brain to become my tool rather than being controlled by it. This experience became a valuable treasure, shaping my attitude towards life and challenges afterwards. I'd like to recommend you the book *The Power of Now*, along with Buddhist classics like The Diamond Sutra and Taoist texts like Tao Te Ching, which are beneficial to all of us, especially who are facing similar difficulties.
