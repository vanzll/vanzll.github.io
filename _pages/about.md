I am Zhenglin Wan (万政霖 in Chinese), an undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans), majoring in Data Science. During my undergraduate, I have been exploring a wide-range of research interests, such as: (inverse) reinforcement learning, smart transportation, spatial-temporal data-mining (and applications like recommender systems), and their intersection. For my future research journey, I envision my research focus on 1)**Decision-Making in Machine Learning**: How to embed the human's learning and decision-making patterns into machine's learning paradigm, such as Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Multi-agent systems? How to enable intelligent agent to perform high-level planning and strategic thinking? I am also interested in adopting statistics and optimization view to understand these problems. 2)**Robot Learning and Embodied AI**: How to equip the robot (or intelligent agent) with human's decision-making ablity?

I have been an intern researcher at [Centre for Frontier AI Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar), [(A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) at Singapore, under the supervision of [Dr. Xingrui Yu](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/yu-xingrui) and [Prof. Ivor Tsang](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang). During my undergraduate, I am lucky to work with [Dr. Jun Song](https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/persons/JUNSONG) and co-found one company, as technical collaborator, named "Metasequoia Intelligence" with him. We have published serveral invention patents and academic papers together. Prior to that, I was the key member of the research group of Prof. [Jianfeng Mao](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/268), playing a key role in a project regarding decision-making systems in transportation network. Meanwhile, I also closely collaborated with Anjun Gao, [Prof. Pingfu Chao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pingfu-Chao), and [Prof. Minghong Fang](https://minghongfang.com/).

- Imitation learning (IL) approaches succeed in fast adaptation for dozens of applications. However, traditional IL assumes the demonstrations comes from one specific expert policy, thus containing only one behavior pattern. This way may result in the lack of robustness of agent to deal with various and unpredicatable real-world situations.
- To address above issue, this work pioneers a new paradigm- learning from diverse behaviors. We proposed a novel quality-diversity imitation learning model to enable the agent to learn a broad set of skills from limited but diverse demonstrations. With multiple viable and high-performing skills equipped, the agent can robustly deal with unseen and stochastic environment.

# Personal Life and History
In my spare time, I’m an **music enthusiast**. I’ve been playing guitar for more than 10 years and began teaching myself the piano and electronic piano at the age of 15. Music has always been a significant part of my life. During my undergraduate, I had the incredible opportunity to play in two bands: "Minor Blue" and "Major Pink." These moments remain some of my most cherished memories. See our photos:

I am also a **15-years chess player**, with the honor of "National Level-3 Athlete". I love the process of comprehensive planning, logical-thinking and inferring. Visit my [Lichess profile](https://lichess.org/@/Carlos1333860).

<div>Several years ago, I was once diagnosised with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder **(OCD, 强迫症 in Chinese)**, specifically Obsessive-Thinking, a mental illness as painful as depression. My mind would get stuck on meaningless details, both academic and personal, generating unrelentless ideas or questions and I couldn’t control it. Realizing that medicine doesn't work for me, I have to rescue myself through the wisdom in mind-philosophy books and exploring Buddhist and Taoist philosophies. The most inspiring part of this journey was learning to practice mindfulness ("正念" in Chinese）—observing what was happening inside my mind **without judging it** and finding inner peace, allowing my brain to become my tool rather than being controlled by it. This experience became a valuable treasure, shaping my attitude towards life and challenges afterwards. I'd like to recommend you the book *The Power of Now*, along with Buddhist classics like The Diamond Sutra and Taoist texts like Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, which are beneficial to all of us, especially who are facing similar difficulties.
