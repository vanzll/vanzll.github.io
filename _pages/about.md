Greetings! I am Zhenglin Wan (‰∏áÊîøÈúñ in Chinese), and I received my Bachelor of Science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) on 2025 Fall. I am currently a visiting (research) student in Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with [Prof. Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/), and I am also an incoming Ph.D. student in [School of Computing (SoC)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/) with NUS research scholarship. My research focus lies in 1)**Embodied AI**: How to embed the human's learning and decision-making patterns into (both virtual and embodied) agentic paradigm? How to enable intelligent agent to perform high-level planning and strategic thinking? 2)**Decision-Making in Machine Learning**: the algorithmic side of reinforcement learning (RL), as well as its intersection with modern generative models.

I have been an intern researcher at [Centre for Frontier AI Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar), [(A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) at Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Ivor Tsang](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang) and collaborated with [Prof. Ong Yew Soon](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/asysong/home.html). In CUHK-Shenzhen campus, I was advised by [Prof. Jianfeng Mao](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/268) and [Prof. Ming Yan](https://mingyan08.github.io/). Besides, I also closely worked with [Prof. Pingfu Chao](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/10/47/c11250a528455/page.htm) and [Dr. Jun Song](https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/persons/JUNSONG) both academically and industrially.

- Imitation learning (IL) approaches succeed in fast adaptation for dozens of applications. However, traditional IL assumes the demonstrations comes from one specific expert policy, thus containing only one behavior pattern. This way may result in the lack of robustness of agent to deal with various and unpredicatable real-world situations.
- To address above issue, this work pioneers a new paradigm- learning from diverse behaviors. We proposed a novel quality-diversity imitation learning model to enable the agent to learn a broad set of skills from limited but diverse demonstrations. With multiple viable and high-performing skills equipped, the agent can robustly deal with unseen and stochastic environment.

**Author:** **Zhenglin Wan**, Anjun Gao, Xingrui Yu, Pingfu Chao*, Jun Song, Maohao Ran

- We proposed a multi-objective imitation learning architecture with variational inference to address the notorious data sparsity and data noise issue in POI data, and we utilize a novel adaptive graphs to capture spatial-temporal dependencies of POI sequences and user patterns.
- Demonstrated that the proposed architecture outperformed the current state-of-the-art by 8%, and by 31% in extremely sparse data scenarios.

# Personal Life and History
In my spare time, I‚Äôm an **music enthusiast**. I‚Äôve been playing guitar for more than 10 years and began teaching myself the piano and electronic piano at the age of 15. Music has always been a significant part of my life. During my undergraduate, I had the incredible opportunity to play in two bands: "Minor Blue" and "Major Pink." These moments remain some of my most cherished memories. See our photos:

I am also a **15-years chess player**, with the honor of "National Level-3 Athlete". I love the process of comprehensive planning, logical-thinking and inferring. Visit my [Lichess profile](https://lichess.org/@/Carlos1333860).

I love play **basketball** üèÄ. Sports makes me energetic.

---

I play video games like **League of Legends**, where I achieved the "diamond" level as my historically highest honor. I also play 3A games like Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Nier Automata, and elder scrolls.

<div>Several years ago, I was once diagnosised with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder **(OCD, Âº∫Ëø´Áóá in Chinese)**, specifically Obsessive-Thinking, a mental illness as painful as depression. My mind would get stuck on meaningless details, both academic and personal, generating unrelentless ideas or questions and I couldn‚Äôt control it. Realizing that medicine doesn't work for me, I have to rescue myself through the wisdom in mind-philosophy books and exploring Buddhist and Taoist philosophies. The most inspiring part of this journey was learning to practice mindfulness ("Ê≠£Âøµ" in ChineseÔºâ‚Äîobserving what was happening inside my mind **without judging it** and finding inner peace, allowing my brain to become my tool rather than being controlled by it. This experience became a valuable treasure, shaping my attitude towards life and challenges afterwards. I'd like to recommend you the book *The Power of Now*, along with Buddhist classics like The Diamond Sutra and Taoist texts like Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, which are beneficial to all of us, especially who are facing similar difficulties.
